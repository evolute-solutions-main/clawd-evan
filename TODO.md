# TODO

Work tasks for Evolute Solutions. Updated 2026-03-18.

## Active

### High Priority
- [x] **Fix Google OAuth** — ✅ Fixed 2026-03-18 (re-authorized, new refresh token)
- [ ] **Fathom → Sales Tracking pipeline** — detect sales calls from Fathom, log to Google Sheet
- [ ] **Data dashboard** — unified view of appointments, sales calls, client metrics

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Appointment tracking via GHL webhooks** — replace Discord channel scraping with GHL API webhooks (more reliable, real-time)
- [ ] **GHL Calendar appointments** — pull scheduled appointments by date (source of truth for *who should show*)
- [ ] **Show rate calculation** — match GHL scheduled appointments against Fathom recordings (Fathom = source of truth for *who actually showed*)
- [ ] **Meta integration** — pull CPL data, check for payment issues, verify campaigns are live

### Lower Priority / Ideas
- [ ] **Closing tracker: "Created By" column** — make it say "Ads" instead of being blank when source is Ads
- [ ] Asana visibility — surface overdue/stalled tasks in sweeps
- [ ] Calendar proactive alerts — flag upcoming meetings, prep reminders
- [ ] Payment tracker and reminder
- [ ] Service term tracker and reminder
- [ ] Fathom call knowledge base — store all call transcripts/summaries for searchable reference

## Architecture Notes

**Appointments & Show Rates:**
- GHL Calendar = scheduled appointments (who was supposed to show)
- Fathom = actual shows (recording exists → they showed)
- Pipeline: GHL appointments for date → Fathom calls for date → match → show rate

**Existing agents:**
- `client-sweep` — daily sweep, runs 06:00 BRT, posts to Discord
- `appointment-tracking` — cold SMS appointment reports
- `fathom` — Fathom API client + scripts

**Blocked:**
- Google Sheets export requires OAuth fix first
- Sales tracking pipeline depends on Sheets
